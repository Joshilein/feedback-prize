    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "Develop models to assess the English language proficiency of 8th–12th grade English Language Learners (ELLs) using their written essays.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Objectives\n",
    "- Provide more accurate, proficiency-sensitive feedback for ELLs.\n",
    "- Help teachers by reducing grading workload.\n",
    "- Enable more appropriate, level-targeted learning tasks for students.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "- Writing practice is limited in schools, especially for ELLs.\n",
    "- Current automated feedback tools do not consider language proficiency, leading to unfair evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "- Code competition - submissions as notebooks\n",
    "- maximum runtime of 9h\n",
    "- internet in kaggle notebook must be turned off\n"

    "\n",
    "### Files Provided\n",
    "- `train.csv`: Contains `text_id`, `full_text`, and scores for all six measures.\n",
